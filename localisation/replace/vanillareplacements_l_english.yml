 news.109.d:0 "Forces from the Deutsches Afrikakorps have fought their way to El-Alamein. \n\nAs Allied forces retreated further into the desert in disarray, German soldiers marching through El-Alamein were cheered as liberators by Bedouin who had come to view the British as oppressors.\n\nThe fall of El-Alamein is a significant loss to the Allied war effort, and several experts have speculated that all of the Middle East now lies open to German conquest."

 france.20.d:0 "The battle is lost. France has collapsed in the face of the German Wehrmacht, the back of the Third Republic that withstood the horrors of the Great War broken by the Blitzkrieg. A repulsive and weak puppet state set up in the town of Vichy grovels pathetically before Germany for mercy.\n\nAlthough France has lost the battle, it has not lost the war and the struggle carries on!  In the wake of the French armistice with Germany and establishment of a new government in Vichy France, a group of senior officers have rebelled against the so-called new French government. Charles de Gaulle has assumed leadership of this new Free French resistance, considering it his sacred duty to save the French people and nation, and to one day reclaim his homeland."
